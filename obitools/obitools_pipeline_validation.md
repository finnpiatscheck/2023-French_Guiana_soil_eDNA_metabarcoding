# OBITools Pipeline Validation

We assume that OBITools 3 is installed.

---

This script is an attempt to work through the OBITools pipeline entirely, understanding each steps, with a subset of data to make the computationally intensive tasks faster and validating the methods used before working the full datasets. Here, there won't be detailed explanation of each steps, but rather exploring and discussing the outputs.

They are several possibilites working with the OBITools, working with different programs often called "Friends" (vsearch, usearch, cutadapt, dada2, lulu, swarm, ) using different methods. In this pipeline, the goal will be to run every useful programs with our data set in order to later chose the appropriate method and/or compare pipelines.

The stop sign &#x1F6D1; will indicate my progress by showing the step that I am at.
