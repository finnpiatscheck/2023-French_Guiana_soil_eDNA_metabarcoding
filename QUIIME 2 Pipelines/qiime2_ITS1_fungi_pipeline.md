# QIIME2 Pipeline for ITS1 Metabarcoding Analysis

---

In this pipeline I will use QIIME2 to perform an analysis of ITS1 reads of soil samples from savanas, pastures, and hurban soils in French Guiana, in order to identify and analyse soil fungi communities. The following pipeline on 16S data is adapted from the physalia course on metbarcoding for microbial ecology (course 30).

In this pipeline, it is assumed that QIIME2 was installed correctly. See the QIIME2 16S pipeline for installation instructions.

The stop sign &#x1F6D1; will indicate my progress by showing the step that I am at.

&#x1F6D1; This pipeline will differ somewhat from the 16S/18S pipeline, notably by using ITSxpress. It is not written yet.
