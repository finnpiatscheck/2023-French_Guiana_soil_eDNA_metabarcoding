# Apscale Pipeline Validation

We assume that Apscale and dependencies are installed.

---

This script is an attempt to work through the Apscale pipeline entirely, understanding each steps, with a subset of data to make the computationally intensive tasks faster and validating the methods used before working the full datasets. Here, there won't be detailed explanation of each steps, but rather exploring and discussing the outputs.
